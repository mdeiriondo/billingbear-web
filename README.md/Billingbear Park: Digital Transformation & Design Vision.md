# Billingbear Park: Digital Transformation & Design Vision

## 1. Executive Summary

The redesign of the Billingbear Park digital platform represents a shift from a purely transactional "pay-and-play" website to a **Heritage-Driven Experience**. Our primary goal was to align the online presence with the actual physical prestige of the course: a historic landscape designed by Martin Hawtree, steeped in Tudor history.

## 2. The Design Philosophy: "Heritage Meets Modernity"

We moved away from the "clinical" look of the previous site to embrace an **English Countryside** aesthetic.

- **Typography:** We introduced *Playfair Display* for headings to evoke the history of the Tudor dynasty and Shakespearean links, balanced with *Inter* for body text to ensure clinical legibility on mobile devices.
- **Colour Palette:** Replacing the generic white and bright green with **Heritage Green (#1A3C34)** and **Paper Cream (#F4F2ED)**. This creates a "premium stationery" feel that is easier on the eyes and feels significantly more sophisticated.

## 3. Old Site vs. New Site: A Comparison

| **Feature**            | **The Old Site (Legacy)**                            | **The New Billingbear Experience**                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First Impression**   | Functional but felt like a generic municipal course. | Premium, historic, and "Royal."                                 |
| **Mobile UX**          | Cluttered lists and difficult-to-click buttons.      | Fluid, touch-first design with a focus on ease of booking.      |
| **Course Information** | Often buried in sub-menus or static text.            | Real-time status integrated into the header.                    |
| **Gifting**            | Standard e-commerce list (uninspiring).              | "Bento Grid" layout focusing on the *experience* of the gift.   |
| **Navigation**         | Static and disconnected from the user journey.       | Adaptive "Command Centre" that follows the user as they scroll. |

## 4. Key Features: The "Plus" Factor

### A. The "Command Centre" (Adaptive Header)

Instead of a simple menu, the new header transforms as the user explores the site. It becomes a **Booking Bar** that allows golfers to:

1. Check the status of both courses instantly.
2. Book a Tee Time without scrolling back to the top.
3. Book a Shuffleboard table as a social alternative.

### B. Intelligent Course Status (The "Reveal" System)

Understanding that Billingbear sits on clay soil, golfers are often concerned about conditions. We implemented a **Dual-Status Bar** for the Old and New courses.

- **The Innovation:** Instead of just a "Green/Yellow" light, we developed a **Reveal System**. Upon hovering (or tapping on mobile), a hidden panel expands to provide specific details (e.g., "Mats only" or "No Buggies"). This provides transparency and builds trust with the player.

### C. Experience-Driven Vouchers

The "Pro Shop" section was redesigned using a **Bento-style grid**. This allows us to highlight "Featured" experiences (like the 18 Holes + Buggy) using large, immersive photography, making them feel like premium gifts rather than just digital barcodes.

### D. Integrated Social Hub (Shuffleboard)

We have integrated the **Shuffleboard** booking system directly into a seamless modal window. This encourages "Aprés Golf" socialising without forcing the user to leave the main site, increasing the likelihood of multi-service bookings.

## 5. Conclusion

The new Billingbear Park website is no longer just a booking tool; it is a **digital extension of the clubhouse**. It respects the 1086 Domesday Book heritage while providing a 2026-ready user experience that is fast, beautiful, and conversion-focused.
